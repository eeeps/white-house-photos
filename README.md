# A Few Photos from the White House

An example responsive images page built for [a](http://cloudinary.com/blog/responsive_images_with_srcset_sizes_and_cloudinary) [pair](http://cloudinary.com/blog/automatically_art_directed_responsive_images) of articles published on the Cloudinary blog.

The [article](https://ericportis.com/etc/cloudinary/castro-on-the-line/) uses Cloudinary’s image transformations in conjunction with the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes in order to vary the resolution of the downloaded image.

The [index](https://ericportis.com/etc/cloudinary/) uses Cloudinary’s transforms with the `<picture>` and `<source media>` elements in order to vary images’ crops and aspect ratios, as well.
